# instagram-follower-bot
* When you want to grow on instagram as a brand, a neat trick is to follow the followers of other accounts which provide similar content as your brand does.
* Now some pages/accounts do have maybe thousands or even millions of followers.
* So obviously we do not have so much time to individually follow each and every follower of our rival brand.
* So why not let python with support of selenium do it ?
* This program automatically logs into your instagram account and goes into your rival brand's profile, and tries to follow all it's followers unless interrupted
